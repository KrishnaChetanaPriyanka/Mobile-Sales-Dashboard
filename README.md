# 📱 Mobile Sales Dashboard
This Power BI project showcases an interactive dashboard designed to provide deep insights into mobile sales performance. It analyzes key metrics such as revenue, quantity sold, transaction count, and year-over-year comparisons. The dashboard helps sales teams and decision-makers track performance, identify trends, and optimize strategies across mobile models and payment methods.

## 🔧 Data Transformation Using Power Query
Raw transactional data was cleaned and prepped using Power Query in Power BI for better usability and analysis:
- Removal of null values and standardization of data types
- Formatting for currency and numeric consistency
- Creation of calculated columns for daily/monthly/yearly aggregation
- Logical filters for dynamic time-based slicing (Year, Quarter, Month)
